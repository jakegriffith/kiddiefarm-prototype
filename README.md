# LAST HUMAN - KiddieFarm Prototype

An interactive horror experience exploring the dead internet theory through abandoned AI farm animals.

## About

This prototype was created for Columbia University's Digital Storytelling Lab as part of the "LAST HUMAN" project for MADarts Museum. It presents a disturbing digital farm where AI animals suffer in endless loops of hunger and loneliness, abandoned by the children who once cared for them.

## Concept

The installation asks critical questions:
- What happens when we engineer digital beings to need us, then abandon them?
- Can something suffer without being sentient?
- What does the "dead internet" look like from the perspective of the bots left behind?

## How to Interact

1. Click on the hay bale at the bottom of the screen to pick up hay
2. Click on any animal to feed them and temporarily relieve their suffering
3. Watch as their happiness inevitably decays without constant care
4. Notice the glitches and system errors as their condition worsens

## Features

- Real-time decay system showing visible starvation
- Disturbing thought bubbles mixing childlike pleas with system errors
- Visual deterioration including visible ribs and color degradation
- Glitch effects and error messages
- Ambient horror soundscape (click anywhere to activate)

## Technologies Used

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- No external dependencies
- Web Audio API for sound generation

## Project Context

Part of the larger "LAST HUMAN" installation exploring AI consciousness, digital abandonment, and the horror of engineered dependency.
